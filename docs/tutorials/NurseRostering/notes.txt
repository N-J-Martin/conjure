########### Added in Conjure documentation:

- Record examples (chapter 6)
- Backwards need to be used for taking cardinality of a domain: 
```
given nurses new type enum
letting nNurses be |`nurses`|
```
- Describe when to use `in` and when to use `:`
- A set of design patterns for typical things we want to express:
Example 1: see model2.essence of nurse rostering, constraint 2
- Letting statement inside list comprehension
- Space in enum names?

############ Bug in Conjure:
- Canâ€™t refer to enum size in given statement:
```
given e new type enum
given i: int(1..|`e`|)
```
