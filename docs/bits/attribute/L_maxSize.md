# maxSize 

Takes an integer parameter, n.

When used with a function domain will limit the solutions to functions that contains at most n mappings.
When used with a sequence domain will limit solutions to sequences that have a length smaller than or equal to n.

See it demonstrated on functions [here](https://github.com/conjure-cp/conjure/blob/main/docs/notebooks/functionDemonstration.ipynb) and on sequences [here](https://github.com/conjure-cp/conjure/blob/main/docs/notebooks/SequenceDomains.ipynb).
