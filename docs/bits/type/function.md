**Function Domains**

Takes 2 ```domains```(this page yet to be written) as arguments: the ```defined``` set and the ```range``` set of the function.
The ```defined```set is the domain of the function - the set of inputs for the function
the ```range``` set is the codomain of the function - the set of possible outputs for the function

```essence
**function** < comma separated attributes(optional)> <defined> --> <range>
```
There are 3 groups of function attributes
  ~ related to cardinality = ```size```, ```minSize```, and ```maxSize```. They take arguments
  ~ related to function properties = ```injective```, ```surjective```, ```bijective```
  ~ related to partiality = ```total```

  Functions are partial by default

  You can also explicity define a function as seen [here.](https://github/conjure-cp/conjure/docs/notebooks/functionDemonstration.ipynb)

  See demonstrations of the function attributes [here.](https://github/conjure-cp/conjure/docs/notebooks/functionDemonstration.ipynb)

  Or see functions used to solve the Magic Hexagon Problem [here.](https://github.com/conjure-cp/conjure/tree/main/docs/notebooks/magicHexagon.ipynb)

  Much of the informatin about functions lifted from [the readthedocs.](https://conjure.readthedocs.io/en/latest/essence.html)
