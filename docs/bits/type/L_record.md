# record

A list of name: domain pairs, of any size.
Denoted by
```
letting x be record{ name1 : domain1, name2: domain2, ...}
```

Like [tuples](https://github.com/conjure-cp/conjure/blob/main/docs/bits/keyword/L_tuple.md), but they are referred to using their labels.

```
x[name1] = domain1
```

This is demonstrated [here](...).
