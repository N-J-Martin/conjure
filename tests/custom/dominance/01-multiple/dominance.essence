$$$ maximality-like dominance

$ When a solution is found, the value of fromSolution(s) can be used to add a nogood.
$ Future solutions should never be subsets of a solution found earlier.
dominance_relation exists i in s . !(i in fromSolution(s))
dominance_relation !(s subsetEq fromSolution(s))

$ Moreover, we know that sets that have the same cardinality will be incomparable.
$ i.e. the nogoods generated by one will not affect the other one.
