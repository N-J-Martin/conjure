letting e be new type enum {E1, E2, E3, E4}

find s,t: permutation of e
find m1 : matrix indexed by [e] of int(1..4)
find m2 : matrix indexed by [e] of int(1..4)
find n1 : matrix indexed by [int(1..2)] of e
find n2 : matrix indexed by [int(1..2)] of e
find x1 : matrix indexed by [e] of e
find x2 : matrix indexed by [e] of e

such that 
    image(s, m1) = m2
  , image(s, n1) = n2
  , image(s, x1) = x2
  , forAll i : e .
