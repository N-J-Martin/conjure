# Permutations spec
Organized by level - each level adding functionality
## 01 representation
Tests permutation behaviour that should work with no rewrite rules.
- permutations must parse correctly in model and parameter files
- the size attribute must constrain the size of the permutation
- enumeration tests for finding permutations
## 02 cardinality 
Test that we can get the number of permuted elements by |p|
- basic cardinality for find, letting, given
## 03 equality
Tests equality on permutations 
- basic equality for find, letting, given
- tests [|p| = i | p <- sp] where sp is a set of permutations
