letting PLAYER be new type enum {Hazard, Modric, Mbappe}
letting nbGamesPerPlayer be function (Hazard --> 10, Modric --> 14, Mbappe --> 18)

$ to parameterise, use the following definitions
$ given PLAYER new type enum
$ given nbGamesPerPlayer : function (total) PLAYER --> int

$ model

letting nbGames be sum([ nb | (player, nb) <- nbGamesPerPlayer ]) / 2

find sides : sequence (size nbGames) of set (size 2) of PLAYER
find winner : sequence (size nbGames) of PLAYER
find loser : sequence (size nbGames) of PLAYER

$ a game is composed of a winner and a loser
such that
