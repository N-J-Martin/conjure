$ graph 4-coloring problem
given
  countries new type enum,
  borders : relation (irreflexive, symmetric) of (countries*countries)

$ where symmetric(borders)
$ such that symmetric(borders)

letting colours be new type enum {red, blue, green, yellow}

find f: function (total) countries --> colours
such that forAll (c,d) in borders . f(c) != f(d)
