given given1: mset (size 5, minOccur 5) of int(4, 4)
find var1: relation (minSize 3, maxSize 3) of (relation (size 1) of (int(3, 5) * bool))
given given2: mset (minSize 3, maxOccur 4 ** 4) of set (size 0) of bool
find var2:
        relation (minSize toInt(true)) of ((int(2, 2), bool) * bool * matrix indexed by [int(3..4, 0..5)] of int(0, 1))
such that
    true,
    false,
