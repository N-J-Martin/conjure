find var1: function (maxSize 2 / 0, total) matrix indexed by [int(2, 0)] of bool --> mset (maxOccur 0) of bool
find var2: relation (minSize 4 % 3) of (partition (minNumParts 4, partSize 5) from bool)
find var3: matrix indexed by [int(5, 2)] of relation (minSize 4) of (bool * bool)
find var4: relation (maxSize 4 ** 3) of (bool * matrix indexed by [int(4, 4)] of bool * set (minSize 1) of bool)
find var5: mset (minSize 0, maxSize 4, maxOccur toInt(false)) of int(5, 3)
