find var1:
        function (minSize 0 , maxSize 4, injective)
            bool --> mset (minSize 4 , maxSize 4, minOccur 2) of bool
find var2:
        (bool, matrix indexed by [int(0..1, 3..3)] of bool, set (size 1) of bool)
find var3:
        partition (numParts toInt(false), regular) from
            mset (minSize 1, maxOccur 0) of bool
find var4:
        matrix indexed by [int(0..3, 0)] of mset (minSize 3, maxOccur 3) of bool
find var5: relation (size 2 % 0) of ((bool, bool))
