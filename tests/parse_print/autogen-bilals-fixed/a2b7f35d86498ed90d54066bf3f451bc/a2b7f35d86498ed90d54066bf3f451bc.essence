find var1:
        function (size -0, total, bijective)
            (bool, bool, bool, bool) --> relation (size 0) of (bool * bool)
find var2: function (minSize -2) bool --> relation (size 0) of (bool)
find var3: relation (maxSize -2) of (bool * set (maxSize 0) of bool)
find var4:
        relation (minSize factorial(3)) of
            (mset (maxSize 4, minOccur 2 , maxOccur 4) of bool)
such that
    false = true,
    true > true,
    false = true
