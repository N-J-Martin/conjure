given given1: partition (minNumParts 2) from int(4, 4..5)
find var1: function (maxSize 0, total, bijective) bool --> bool
given given2: matrix indexed by [int(5, 2)] of int(1, 2)
find var2: (int(1..2, 5), int(1..3, 5), bool, int(5, 0..3))
find var3: (bool, int(5, 1), bool, int(2..3, 0))
find var4: function (size 0, total, surjective) bool --> int(3..5, 1..4)
such that false != false
