find x_Occurrence: matrix indexed by [int(1)] of bool
find y_Occurrence: matrix indexed by [int(1)] of bool
branching on [x_Occurrence, y_Occurrence]
such that
    toInt(x_Occurrence[1] /\ y_Occurrence[1]) = 0,
    toInt(x_Occurrence[1] /\ y_Occurrence[1]) <= 0,
    x_Occurrence[1] /\ y_Occurrence[1] -> false,
    0 <= toInt(x_Occurrence[1] /\ y_Occurrence[1])
